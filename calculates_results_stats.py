# PROGRAMMER: Abhijith Ganesh   
# DATE CREATED:28 November                                  
# REVISED DATE: 
# PURPOSE: Create a function calculates_results_stats that calculates the 
#          statistics of the results of the programrun using the classifier's model 
#          architecture to classify the images. This function will use the 
#          results in the results dictionary to calculate these statistics. 
#          This function will then put the results statistics in a dictionary
#          (results_stats_dic) that's created and returned by this function.
#          This will allow the user of the program to determine the 'best' 
#          model for classifying the images. The statistics that are calculated
#          will be counts and percentages. Please see "Intro to Python - Project
#          classifying Images - xx Calculating Results" for details on the 
#          how to calculate the counts and percentages for this function.    
#         This function inputs:
#            -The results dictionary as results_dic within calculates_results_stats 
#             function and results for the function call within main.
#         This function creates and returns the Results Statistics Dictionary -
#          results_stats_dic. This dictionary contains the results statistics 
#          (either a percentage or a count) where the key is the statistic's 
#           name (starting with 'pct' for percentage or 'n' for count) and value 
#          is the statistic's value.  This dictionary should contain the 
#          following keys:
#            n_images - number of images
#            n_dogs_img - number of dog images
#            n_notdogs_img - number of NON-dog images
#            n_match - number of matches between pet & classifier labels
#            n_correct_dogs - number of correctly classified dog images
#            n_correct_notdogs - number of correctly classified NON-dog images
#            n_correct_breed - number of correctly classified dog breeds
#            pct_match - percentage of correct matches
#            pct_correct_dogs - percentage of correctly classified dogs
#            pct_correct_breed - percentage of correctly classified dog breeds
#            pct_correct_notdogs - percentage of correctly classified NON-dogs
#
##
# TODO 5: Define calculates_results_stats function below, please be certain to replace None
#       in the return statement with the results_stats_dic dictionary that you create 
#       with this function
